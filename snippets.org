** Lowering an image's background
Sometimes, images I want to use as wallpapers are too bright. To "dim" them,
you can do:

#+begin_src bash
convert <file> -modulate <value> <new-file>
#+end_src

Here, =convert= is an =imagemagick= utility. =<value>= is made up of three values:
brightness, saturation and hue. Therefore, to achieve the effect of "dimming" an 
image, you would set =<value>= to something like =40,50,100=.
