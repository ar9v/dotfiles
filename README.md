# Dotfiles #

This is my dotfiles repository. It contains some of the essential files for a working i3 configuration with xterm and some vim madness. Needless to say, it is pretty **shabby**. It's mostly for personal use, but feel free
to rummage around; you might find something of use (but only in virtue of me using something someone else has made). 

That leads me to my next point: my dotfiles are a messy compilation of great ideas conceived by many people whom, in my naïveté, I have not kept track of. In the (very unlikely) event that you one of those minds, I 
apologize profusely.
